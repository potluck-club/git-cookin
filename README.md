# git-cookin

A repository dedicated to preserving the best flavors of 
[potluck club]("known aliases GOT potluck, Naptime potluck"),
for likely eventual transoformation into some physical entity.

## Ingredients

* Every recipe herein must have been cooked for some potluck by a `primary chef`
* Every recipe must have an awesome name 
* Every recipe shall be made to look consistently awesome, to do so we shall implement a common theme and template recipes using `LaTeX` 
* Not every recipe in this pot will have the luck 
to be included in the final binding, as such we will discuss some (probably multiple) filters
